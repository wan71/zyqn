Related violations: <none>

DPIP-1#1 Warning
Input pipelining  
DSP system_i/Bic_top_0/inst/writeNextValidLine_reg2 input system_i/Bic_top_0/inst/writeNextValidLine_reg2/A[29:0] is not pipelined. Pipelining DSP48 input will improve performance.
Related violations: <none>

DPOP-1#1 Warning
PREG Output pipelining  
DSP system_i/Bic_top_0/inst/writeNextValidLine_reg2 output system_i/Bic_top_0/inst/writeNextValidLine_reg2/P[47:0] is not pipelined (PREG=0). Pipelining the DSP48 output will improve performance and often saves power so it is suggested whenever possible to fully pipeline this function.  If this DSP48 function was inferred, it is suggested to describe an additional register stage after this function.  If the DSP48 was instantiated in the design, it is suggested to set the PREG attribute to 1.
Related violations: <none>

DPOP-2#1 Warning
MREG Output pipelining  
DSP system_i/Bic_top_0/inst/writeNextValidLine_reg2 multiplier stage system_i/Bic_top_0/inst/writeNextValidLine_reg2/P[47:0] is not pipelined (MREG=0). Pipelining the multiplier function will improve performance and will save significant power so it is suggested whenever possible to fully pipeline this function.  If this multiplier was inferred, it is suggested to describe an additional register stage after this function.  If there is no registered adder/accumulator following the multiply function, two pipeline stages are suggested to allow both the MREG and PREG registers to be used.  If the DSP48 was instantiated in the design, it is suggested to set both the MREG and PREG attributes to 1 when performing multiply functions.
Related violations: <none>

DPOR-1#1 Warning
Asynchronous load check  
DSP system_i/Bic_top_0/inst/writeNextValidLine_reg2 output is connected to registers with an asynchronous reset (system_i/Bic_top_0/inst/writeNextValidLine_reg[0]).

The RAMB18E1 system_i/Bic_top_0/inst/ramRB/ram_generate[0].ram_inst_i/ram_reg has an input control pin system_i/Bic_top_0/inst/ramRB/ram_generate[0].ram_inst_i/ram_reg/ADDRARDADDR[13] (net: system_i/Bic_top_0/inst/ramRB/ram_generate[0].ram_inst_i/ram_reg_i_1__0_n_0) which is driven by a register (system_i/Bic_top_0/inst/writeColCount_reg[11]) that has an active asychronous set or reset. This may cause corruption of the memory contents and/or read values when the set/reset is asserted and is not analyzed by the default static timing analysis. It is suggested to eliminate the use of a set/reset to registers driving this RAMB pin or else use a synchronous reset in which the assertion of the reset is timed by default.

REQP-165#1 Advisory
writefirst  
Synchronous clocking is detected for BRAM (system_i/axi_vdma_0/U0/I_PRMRY_DATAMOVER/GEN_MM2S_FULL.I_MM2S_FULL_WRAPPER/GEN_INCLUDE_MM2S_SF.I_RD_SF/I_DATA_FIFO/BLK_MEM.I_SYNC_FIFOGEN_FIFO/xpm_fifo_instance.xpm_fifo_sync_inst/xpm_fifo_base_inst/gen_sdpram.xpm_memory_base_inst/gen_wr_a.gen_word_narrow.mem_reg_1) in SDP mode with WRITE_FIRST write-mode. This is the preferred mode for best power characteristics, however it may exhibit address collisions if the same address appears on both read and write ports resulting in unknown or corrupted read data. It is suggested to confirm via simulation that an address collision never occurs and if so it is suggested to try and avoid this situation. If address collisions cannot be avoided, the write-mode may be set to READ_FIRST which guarantees that the read data is the prior contents of the memory at the cost of additional power in the design. See the FPGA Memory Resources User Guide for additional information.
